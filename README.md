<h5># What is it</h5>
A simple shell in which you can write commands looking at unix binaries and builtins. This shell manages multipipes, redirections and separators. A bashrc reader is started and read, at this moment, aliases and exported variables from the 42shrc (file name can be changed in the header i.e macro SHRC).
