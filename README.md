# PSU_42sh_2019
<h5># What is it</h5>
A simple shell in which you can write commands looking at unix binaries and builtins. This shell manages multipipes, redirections and separators. A bashrc reader is started and read, at this moment, aliases and exported variables from the 42shrc (file name can be changed in the header i.e macro SHRC).

<h5># How to use</h5>
 <li>First build the project executing make</li>
 <li>Launch on a command file with ./42sh file</li></li>
 <li>Launch with piped commands with echo "command" | ./42sh</li>
 <li>Launch as normal mode with ./42sh</li>
 <li>Exit shell pressing ^D</li>
The code respects Epitech-Norm and contains no memory leak and no error.
